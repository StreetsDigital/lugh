# Get up to speed on an unfamiliar codebase

name: Codebase Onboarding
description: Understand a new codebase from architecture to conventions
estimated_time: 1-2 hours

steps:
  - agent: arch-investigator
    task: Map the overall architecture, components, and data flow
    output: docs/architecture-overview.md
    compact_after: true

  - agent: audit-docs
    task: Review existing documentation quality and gaps
    output: docs/documentation-audit.md
    compact_after: true

  - agent: audit-tests
    task: Understand test structure and coverage
    output: docs/test-overview.md
    compact_after: false

  After this chain you'll understand:
  - How the system is architected
  - What documentation exists (and what's missing)
  - How tests are organized
  Great for onboarding to a new project.
