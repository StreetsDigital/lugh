# Explain This Codebase

I'm new to this codebase. Give me a 5-minute orientation:

1. **What it does** (one paragraph)
2. **Tech stack** (languages, frameworks, databases)
3. **Architecture** (main components and how they connect)
4. **Entry points** (where does execution start?)
5. **Key files** (the 5-10 most important files to understand)
6. **Data flow** (how does data move through the system?)

Keep it practical. I want to start contributing, not read a thesis.
