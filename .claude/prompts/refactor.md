# Refactor This

Refactor this code for clarity and maintainability:

1. **Identify smells**: What's wrong with it now?
2. **Propose changes**: What specific refactors will help?
3. **Execute**: Show me the refactored code
4. **Preserve behaviour**: Ensure functionality unchanged

Focus on:
- Extracting functions/methods (single responsibility)
- Better naming
- Reducing complexity
- Removing duplication
- Improving testability

Do NOT change functionality. This is purely structural improvement.
