# Write Spec

Write a technical specification for this feature:

1. **Overview**: What are we building? (2-3 sentences)
2. **Goals**: What problems does this solve?
3. **Non-goals**: What are we explicitly NOT doing?
4. **Design**: How will it work?
   - Data model changes
   - API changes
   - UI changes (if any)
5. **Implementation plan**: Rough phases/milestones
6. **Open questions**: What still needs deciding?

Keep it concise. One page max. This is for the team, not a client.
