# Performance Analysis

Analyse this code for performance issues:

1. **Hotspots**: Where is time/memory being spent?
2. **Complexity**: Any O(n²) or worse algorithms?
3. **I/O**: Unnecessary database/network calls?
4. **Memory**: Allocations that could be avoided?
5. **Concurrency**: Blocking operations? Race conditions?

For each issue:
- Severity (High/Medium/Low)
- Location (file:line)
- Current behaviour
- Recommended fix
- Expected improvement

Prioritise by impact. I want the biggest wins first.
